The main way to deal with typography is through the components in `src/components/common/Text.js`.

# Typeface & fonts

The main font is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). The colors can vary from `black.50` to `black.900` (the darkest).

```jsx
import { P } from '../../src/components/common/Text';
<div>
  <P color='black.100'>100: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P color='black.200'>200: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P color='black.300'>300: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P color='black.400'>400: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P color='black.500'>500: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P color='black.600'>600: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P color='black.700'>700: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P color='black.800'>800: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P color='black.900'>900: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
</div>;
```

# Type scale

You can configure the scale through `fontSize` and `lineHeight` props.

```jsx
import { P } from '../../src/components/common/Text';
<div>
  <P fontSize='H1'>H1: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P fontSize='H2'>H2: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P fontSize='H3'>H3: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P fontSize='H4'>H4: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
  <P fontSize='H5'>H5: We are on a mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.</P>
